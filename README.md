gurumate
========

A library of platform-independent tools that ease gathering information about the system. It powers the SimTry practice environment and enables the patented gurumate technology to provide accurate hints. The Gurumate SDK is platform agnostic and it currently supports Linux and Windows operating systems; it is also extensible and grows to support whatever the new labs need.
